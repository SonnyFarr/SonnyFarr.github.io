Bio limited to 100 words for presenter

	I am a freshman student in Cybersecurity and Computer Science. I've worked around the industry for several years, and have complimentary skills, and am looking to make a transition to IT as a long term career.

Detailed outline or description of the topic. Get into the meat of what the presentation is about in detail.

	The first part is defining OSINT. What is it, and how do you already use it in your day-to-day. From there, I go into a few quick examples (TBD) using some photos, or fragments of information, then digging into what we can find. The next example will be to show how this can be used as an attack vector. Lastly, will be a few slides dedicated to how you can limit your exposure.
