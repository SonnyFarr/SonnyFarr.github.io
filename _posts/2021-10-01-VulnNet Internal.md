Slightly different layout this time, since it's one Task with 4 flags. This one took a bit longer than normal, as I wasn't as familiar with some of the tools and commands as before. I had to go through some walkthroughs, and some crash courses, but was able to get through everything. After timing out one too many times, I eventually setup my VM for Kali Linux, and used the Open VPN setup to connect to tryhackme, so that I could work for more than an hour at a time. So overall, net win.
