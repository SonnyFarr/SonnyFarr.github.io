Task 1 - join room

Task 2 - Social Engineering - A breif overview of what social engineering is, with a specific example of dropping USB drives near a target location (or where people who work at that location gather) and hoping someone picks it up and plugs it into a sensitive device/network.

Task 3 - Social Engineering, Phishing - Explains phishing (and a little on smishing, vishing, spear-phishing, and whaling). Read through examples to get the flag. 

Task 4 - Malware and Ransomware - Explains malware and ransomware. Gives a breif example using the wannacry ransomware from a while back.

Task 5 - Passwords and Authentication - Explains credential stuffing, and what we used to think of as a reasonably secure password. However, it does recommend going to a passphrase, as the length makes it near impossible to crack (or guess) if done right. Also a fun little example of wordlists.

Task 6 - Multi-Factor Authentication and Password Managers - Explains why MFA is more secure, gives some options of password managers, and why SMS isn't the *best* option.

Task 7 - Public Network Safety - Why VPNs are useful, MITM attacks, TLS and HTTPS, and general safety tips.

Task 8 - Backups - General backup tips. 3 instances, 2 mediums, and at least 1 off-site. Also, make sure they're up to date, as year old backups aren't useful.

Task 9 - Updates and Patches - Why you run updates, and why patches are good.

Task 10 - Conclusion - A wrap-up.

Overall, a nice, basic overview of some of the common attacks/concerns that exist in the cybersecurity world.
