title: Metasploit

Task 1 - Intro - just making sure you have the program.

Task 2 - Initializing - Initialize the database, then use the -h to learn a little about the program.

Task 3 - Rock 'em to the Core [Commands] - Deeper dive into the help menu to learn about functions, options, and what Metasploit can do.

Task 4 - Modules for Every Occasion! - Reading. All of the answers are available on the slide so not terribly difficult.

Task 5 - Move that shell! - Now we launch the VM, and start looking for vulnerabilities. This was a fairly straightforward walkthrough, and was easy to follow.

Task 6 - We're in, now what? - More reading through the manual (which updates depending on which modules are loaded, which is nice). Did take a little Google-fu to locate the load kiwi command.

Task 7 - Makin' Cisco Proud - Did a little reading from the help menu to set a subnet, and had to look up more information on Metasploit to get the last 2.
