Task 1 - Introduction - reading

Task 2 - An Unknown Land - reading, Wikipedia research

Task 3 - Small size, a lot of destruction. - Spent longer than I want to admit trying to use attack box to run the program. Ran the sample through MobSF and took some basic readings.

Task 4 - Digging Deeper - Used virustotal.com to do a deeper dive into the sample. Found an error with one of the questions asking for the wrong information. Brought it up on the Discord channel.

Task 5 - MobSFing the sample. - Digging a little deeper with MobSF into the sample.

Task 6 - It doesn't smell good! - Using the second sample, and getting more granular results. Using virustotal.com and more wikipedia research.

Task 7 - Conclusion - Wrap up, additional reading material.
