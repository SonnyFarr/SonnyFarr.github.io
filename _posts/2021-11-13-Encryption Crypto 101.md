tryhackme.com room

This was a lot like the previous try hack me room. It was presented as a lecture with some hands on trials, which I enjoy as I learn a new skill. Overall, it was a fairly straightforward approach to something that seems to be vastly complicated under the hood. 

Going through this assignment wasn't terribly difficult, though I did have to look up how to use JohntheRipper, but that was only a couple of minutes of tinkering. Overall, I enjoyed this room and it's approach.
