title: Rate Limiting with Cloud Armor
---
This is my experience with the Google Cloud training that we were able to select. I went with Rate Limiting with Cloud Armor.

I followed the directions, created some policies, and ran a VM. I still frankly have no idea what I did. Nothing was explained. It was "click this, type this, select this, done!". There was no explanation for why we did any of the steps, and no explanation for how different options would have changed things. I learned nothing at all. Going through this training was abysmal; if I didn't set something up perfectly, it just told me to do it again, never explaining what was wrong, or where to look. If I had paid money for this training, I would be demanding my money back. I feel like watching a YouTube tutorial, or reading a walkthrough written by someone who uses the service would have been infinitely more useful.
